# Web application for graph visualization and search using Neo4j and d3.js

This project involves the development of a web application designed for graph visualization and search, utilizing Neo4j and D3.js technologies. The application allows users to create their own graphs and visualize various algorithms through dynamic animations, enhancing the learning and understanding of graph theory concepts.

#Technologies Used:
#Neo4j: 
A graph database that excels in storing, managing, and querying interconnected data through a graphical model. Utilizing Cypher, a declarative query language, Neo4j simplifies complex data relationships, making it an essential tool across various industries.

#D3.js: 
A JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. D3.js connects data to DOM elements, enabling real-time responsiveness to user interactions and data updates. Its built-in animations and transitions enhance user engagement and understanding of complex data.

#HTML: 
The foundational markup language used for structuring web pages, allowing for the organization of various content types.

#CSS: 
A styling language used to control the visual presentation of web pages, ensuring a clean separation between design and content.

#JavaScript: 
The programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. JavaScript integrates seamlessly with HTML and CSS, enabling real-time content and style updates based on user actions.
